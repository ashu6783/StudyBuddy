# ExpertBuddy - Next.js Internship Assignment

This project is a solution for the ExpertBuddy internship assignment. It showcases a fully responsive web application built with **Next.js v15**, **Tailwind CSS**, and modern component libraries such as **Shadcn/UI** and **Magic UI**, focusing on clean architecture, performance, and user experience .

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> - No database is connected. Authentication is simulated using `localStorage`.  
> - Document filtering and rendering use mock data from `/lib/data.ts`.  
> - The "Purchase Model" and dynamic "Documents by Type" logic are under development.

### Improvements: 
  Purchase Model still not implemented is to be done.
  Documents by Type is to connected .
